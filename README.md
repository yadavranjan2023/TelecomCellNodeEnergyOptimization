# TelecomCellNodeEnergyOptimization
 Technical Summary: Energy Optimization Model for Telecom Cell Nodes
 
 **Overview**
 The energy optimization model is designed for telecom cell nodes, incorporating millimeter wave (mmWave) data and telecommunications-specific features such as signal strength, user density, and interference levels. The model aims to predict energy consumption and optimize resource utilization while considering factors like inference cost, throughput, and latency.

Key Components
  1. **Data Preparation** - Synthetic dataset creation with 1000 samples. - Features include: - 10 mmWave data features. - Signal strength. - User density. - Interference level. - Energy consumption as the target variable.
  2. **Sliding Window and Rotation Buffer** - **Sliding Window**: Retains a fixed number of recent data samples (e.g., window size of 50). - **Rotation Buffer**: Manages spectrum data efficiently with a fixed buffer size (e.g., buffer size of 10).
  3.  **Model Training** - Uses linear regression to train the model. - Splits data into training and testing sets (80-20 split). - Evaluates model performance using mean squared error (MSE).
  4.   **Continuous Batching** - Processes data in batches at regular intervals to optimize resource utilization. - Batch size is configurable (e.g., batch size of 5).
  5.   **Inference Cost, Throughput, and Latency** - Measures latency (time taken for inference). - Calculates throughput (inferences per second). - Computes cost of inference (e.g., arbitrary cost per inference).

  Pocess Flow
  1. Data Initialization: Load and prepare the synthetic dataset, adding initial data to the sliding window and rotation buffer.
  2. Model Training: Train a linear regression model using the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set.
  3. Optimization Function: - Uses the trained model to predict energy consumption for new mmWave data. - Implements continuous batching to process data efficiently. - Measures latency, calculates throughput, and computes inference cost for each batch.
  
  Example Usage - The script includes an example usage scenario with new mmWave data and simulated cache data. - The `optimize_energy_usage` function processes new data in batches, providing predictions along with latency, throughput, and cost metrics for each batch. This approach ensures efficient energy optimization for telecom cell nodes by leveraging recent data retention, continuous batching, and thorough performance tracking.
